You can be stubborn, especially if your pride is involved. You are idealistic, and people have to prove to you that they have integrity.
You like to have rich and elegant things that you can show off to others. But remember that just because something impresses people, it is not necessarily good. You need to learn the difference.

Whenever possible, you try to help others, because it makes you feel good about yourself.
Very often you like to go into your own private fantasy world and think about ideas that mean something only to you. Just don't spend so much time there that you lose track of what is happening outside in the real world.

You are very social, and you have learned early in life to get along with others. For this reason, you are able to help others patch up an argument, because you see both sides of the controversy.
Some people express another side of the seventh-house Sun. You may really feel like arguing and fighting with others, instead of trying to get along. Don't make a habit of it, because everyone gets tired of fighting eventually.
You should learn to be more independent. Also avoid making compromises that require you to give up something essential just to keep a friend.
