Hello 2014,

As people know, I’m not too keen on new year resolutions, so I’ve
decided on a few things I would like to do this year.

-   **Learn Russian as a language** - I’ve always been interested in
    what those crazy glyphs mean, as well as most the population know
    more than one language, I’d like to learn something new. Also, I
    like the way it sounds.
-   **Make a song** - There’s an [Oxygen 49][] that’s been gathering
    dust that I really should put to good use. It’s just sitting there,
    collecting dust, looking fancy with all it’s numerous knobs and
    sliders and doing fuck all. I need to learn piano first, so that’s
    also on the cards. I have [Synthesia][] and it’s learning pack that
    will give me some ground.
-   **Start dating again** - It’s been over 2 years since I’ve had a
    girlfriend. It’s been a long time and I’m kinda shy about the idea.
    I would just like to spend time with someone and do fun things with.
    Also fun dumb things. It also gets harder to date as you get older.
-   **Write Some Blog Posts** - I pay for this domain and hosting,
    although I don’t really put it to good use. Let’s change that.
    People like my posting, right? Hopefully I can post something once a
    week. Hooray.
-   **Get out more** - I’ve spent way too much time watching TV in the
    last year and staying home, hermitising (hermitosis?). It’s too
    comfortable to me now and it has to change. I may even start running
    and roller derby training again (Although I desperately need new
    skates to do that). I may even take up Lazer Blaze!

I think that wraps it up. I just need to plan and make some short term
goals, weekly goals. They seem more achievable short term, but hopefully
will run into long term.

Wish me luck. Actually, don’t. I can do this. (Edit: He did not)
