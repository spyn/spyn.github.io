Last night I compiled a list of tones I would like to use on my phone.
Most of them are based from classic Commodore 64 games. I spent about 4
hours converting SID to WAV, then to MP3 to save space on my phone. Just
thought I would share.

The download link is ad sponsored by [adf.ly][], I did this so I could
recieve some credit for my 4 hours work. So deal with it. Itâ€™s also
about 60MB. So, enjoy!
