As a few of you already know, I’ve been slowly working on a secret zone
stats projects. It’ll be hosted on [zone-girls.com][] until I can afford
a new domain name and hosting.

The data will be collected by Torn XML files and it will also be
manually entered if data is pre-Torn. You will be able to select a
tournament, or a competition. The interface will show a table of the
teams (leader board style) where the user can click on a team for a
certain to break down into the team’s scores over the season, bested
colour as well as other stats. Then it’ll have links to the players on
the team then bring up stats for that player, in that certain
tournament. It will also link to the players “global” profile, listing
their achievements, teams and competitions participated in. Highest rank
in x. MVP count. Number of trophies. That kinda junk.

The post production name is not set in stone, so I’m using Zone Warriors
as the name.

There will be pretty graphs, no doubt about that. Also an achievement
system where I am happy for suggestions. Leave a comment here or a
message on the [Darkzone WA forums][].
