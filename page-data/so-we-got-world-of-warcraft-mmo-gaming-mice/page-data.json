They look pretty great, having 15 buttons, cool\nglowing OLED that pulsates. It takes a while to get used to the handling\nand the design since it’s a bit different to normal, more ergonomic\nmice. But apart from that, so far, the hardware acts really well. The\nbuttons are well placed and it’s very good.</p>\n<p>One slight problem. The software that comes with is absolute crap. <a href=\"http://www.fragyou.net/2009/09/24/wow-mmo-gaming-mouse-ap-mfc-error/\">It’s\nvery poorly written.</a> It can’t even handle malformed XML and will just\ncrash. Error handling? Jesus christ learn how to. I tried to simply\nimport a profile via the armory and I get an AP MFC error. Why? because\nthe image location has changed or something. How hard would of it been\nto, say if there was an error. 1) Display there was an error getting the\nimage 2) Replace it with a stock image. Oh, the images? they’re STOCK\nIMAGES AND DO NOT REALLY CHANGE. You could of distributed them with the\npackage.</p>\n<p>The only problems I have had though, are to do with profile handling.</p>\n<p>The other options in the software are okay, such as setting up key\nbindings, macros and junk like that. I’ve recently bought my mouse into\nwork and bound cut, paste, hide desktop, tab forward, tab backward,\nbuild, build project and it works pretty well.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"World of Warcraft MMO gaming mice","date":"2009, Oct 02","tags":["gaming","world-of-warcraft"],"img":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7b978f47489e73affc53dadbb4b34750/900c0/wow-mouse.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7b978f47489e73affc53dadbb4b34750/787cf/wow-mouse.jpg 750w,\n/static/7b978f47489e73affc53dadbb4b34750/900c0/wow-mouse.jpg 785w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7b978f47489e73affc53dadbb4b34750/6203d/wow-mouse.avif 750w,\n/static/7b978f47489e73affc53dadbb4b34750/f58b2/wow-mouse.avif 785w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/7b978f47489e73affc53dadbb4b34750/81950/wow-mouse.webp 750w,\n/static/7b978f47489e73affc53dadbb4b34750/076cf/wow-mouse.webp 785w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5579617834394904}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/so-we-got-world-of-warcraft-mmo-gaming-mice/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/combined-graph-in-asp-net-with-owc/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Combined graph in ASP.NET with OWC","tags":["code",".net","web-dev"],"img":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c2ad0481983f7fb402822530e5feb165/e9a85/owc-asp.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c2ad0481983f7fb402822530e5feb165/e9a85/owc-asp.jpg 440w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/c2ad0481983f7fb402822530e5feb165/69836/owc-asp.webp 440w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.42954545454545456}}}}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/reactivated-some-eve-online/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reactivated some EVE Online","tags":["eve-online","gaming"],"img":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/612c71da0fbacc68711d4621701b37a1/8f8af/eve-goons.jpg","srcSet":"/static/612c71da0fbacc68711d4621701b37a1/3541d/eve-goons.jpg 750w,\n/static/612c71da0fbacc68711d4621701b37a1/8f8af/eve-goons.jpg 785w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/612c71da0fbacc68711d4621701b37a1/a4fab/eve-goons.webp 750w,\n/static/612c71da0fbacc68711d4621701b37a1/f67b3/eve-goons.webp 785w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.36433121019108283}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2478211480","63159454"]}
