I sat down tied my skates up then hit the rink. The first thing I\ndo when I get on the rink is to check the grip and holy shit – my wheels\ndid not stick to the ground. This is quite awesome because it meant one\nthing. The last times I’ve been skating I haven’t been able to\npowerslide properly; powersliding is where you put all your weight on\nyour wheels going the opposite side to where you were skating, it also\nmakes loud noises and sometimes sparks (if you’re lucky).</p>\n<p>This was so great. It meant that I had pretty much the best control I\ncould have. Reminded me of back when I used to skate at Rolloways as a\nteenager being able to do freaky skate shit, like diving in between\nclumps of people who are slowly skating around. Catching that half a\nsecond window you get between people and sneaking up to someone and\nletting a massive sounding powerslide go.</p>\n<p>I’ve been skating for a pretty long time, ever since I was 13. I took it\nup because I really slow at running and I needed something to do in my\nspare time; skating seemed pretty good. Started with the learn to skate\nprogram, did all the star classes and ended up pretty decent at skating.\n(I will not mention that it was a figure skating class either… then\nagain I was one of the few people that figure skated in speed skates)</p>\n<p>It’s just so exciting feeling the air rush through you, knowing you are\nin complete control and you can recover from any slight slip-up with mad\nbalance control.</p>\n<p>I’ve been going road skating a fair bit. My recent and longest skate\ngoing at a constant speed (mostly because there was NO ONE at all on the\nfoot/bike paths) was the following <a href=\"http://www.runkeeper.com\">RunKeeper</a> entry:\n<a href=\"http://rnkpr.com/a5rhfd%20\">&#x3C;http://rnkpr.com/a5rhfd></a>. Of course, this skate might of effected\nmy wheels as I was using rinky wheels instead of road wheels. My axels\nare fucked okay.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to some more skating. Considering being a <a href=\"http://wftda.com/officiating\">referee</a>\nfor the <a href=\"http://www.perthrollerderby.com.au/\">upcoming roller derby</a> games. I think learning a massive\nrulebook to see girls beat and trip each other up would be well worth\nit. ;)</p>\n<p>And that, is how I roll.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I got my wheels back","date":"2010, May 19","tags":["rollerskating"],"img":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEAf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAED/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHZnLnWsSD/AP/EABkQAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMREv/aAAgBAQABBQLXRIjTyelRcItdrrP/xAAWEQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBH/2gAIAQMBAT8BhX//xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIf/aAAgBAgEBPwGI/8QAGRAAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERMSEi/9oACAEBAAY/Aj0ulkE0oaaf/8QAGxAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERQSExUZH/2gAIAQEAAT8hxaabLA5CxDJw2ybdyWhQeo//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEBDP/8QAFhEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBFB/9oACAEDAQE/EKMf/8QAFhEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAER/9oACAECAQE/ELA2P//EABsQAQADAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExQVFh/9oACAEBAAE/EGxAOu2VQ2ZfIqrzjHIFOyRvkvbjZ09FP2AW89KFWz//2Q=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3a8982aec67161a5946b06a4b4cfe8d4/42b11/skates.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3a8982aec67161a5946b06a4b4cfe8d4/42b11/skates.jpg 524w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3a8982aec67161a5946b06a4b4cfe8d4/39316/skates.avif 524w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/3a8982aec67161a5946b06a4b4cfe8d4/de06e/skates.webp 524w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.648854961832061}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/i-got-my-wheels-back/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/zone-warriors-updates/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Zone Warriors updates","tags":["laser-tag","code"],"img":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f51ee5bf8470146ba0e7a71c5088c88c/00d5d/darkzone-malaga.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f51ee5bf8470146ba0e7a71c5088c88c/00d5d/darkzone-malaga.jpg 612w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f51ee5bf8470146ba0e7a71c5088c88c/7d1d8/darkzone-malaga.webp 612w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5669934640522876}}}}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/maybe-a-bit-more-about-my-inner-geek/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Maybe a bit more about my inner geek","tags":["ii-topgeek"],"img":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/eb8612dad07f61aa373dfdcb5c11aca6/fb1ca/topgeek2.jpg","srcSet":"/static/eb8612dad07f61aa373dfdcb5c11aca6/f6e84/topgeek2.jpg 750w,\n/static/eb8612dad07f61aa373dfdcb5c11aca6/fb1ca/topgeek2.jpg 785w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/eb8612dad07f61aa373dfdcb5c11aca6/7d222/topgeek2.webp 750w,\n/static/eb8612dad07f61aa373dfdcb5c11aca6/6e09c/topgeek2.webp 785w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.43312101910828027}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2478211480","63159454"]}
