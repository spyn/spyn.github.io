I did have to\nrun an expert install so I could dual boot. I was running Ubuntu on the\ndrive, but I had to make sure it reformatted the partition</p>\n<p>I did run into a few problems, after installation though, which is\nunderstandable since SteamOS is -in beta-.</p>\n<h3>Black screen after installation</h3>\n<p>It looks like the Radeon card doesn’t work straight out of “the box”</p>\n<p>I had to follow these steps in order to get the video card working, from\nReddit <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamOS/comments/22pgp3/working_suggestions_for_black_screen_after/\">Working suggestions for black screen after</a></p>\n<p>After getting that all sorted, the next problem I ran into</p>\n<h3>Network problems</h3>\n<p>I had some interesting networking problems. My RealTech network card was\nnot installed by default. I had to insmod the device, then manually\nsetup the network card.</p>\n<p>It began to install Steam, and in the Steam installation, the network\ncard lost connectivity, for some odd reason, I had to fix it in the\nnetwork manager conf file, and set it to managed.

It appears that having\nVirtualBox installed messes with the network metric[4]</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Workaround - 1. Open up Network and Sharing Center \n2. Click ‘Change Adapter Settings’ \n3. Right click ‘VirtualBox Host-Only Network’, go to Properties \n4. Double click “Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)‘under ’This connection uses the following items’. \n5. In the Properties page,\nclick”Advanced…&quot; \n6. In the “Advanced TCP/IP Settings”, tab “IP\nSettings”, uncheck the box marked “Automatic Metic” and type in 800 or\nhigher.</code></pre></div>\n<p>OK all dialogs and run whatever software could not Recieve multicast.</p>\n<p>The problem stems from Microsoft assigning interface Metrics based on\nthe driver’s own reported Link speed in Windows 7. Since that’s all 1GB,\nthere is a clash on metric.
