It\r\nis a faily old beast.</p>\n<p>Processor: Intel Duo\r\nMemory: xGB\r\nHard Drive: 40GB space allocated\r\nVideo Card: AMD RADEON\r\nJoystick: XBOX 360 controller</p>\n<p>Although, my main goal was to Steam Stream games from my desktop, which\r\nhas way more power behind it.</p>\n<p>The installation did run smoothly, nice hints of debian. I did have to\r\nrun an expert install so I could dual boot. I was running Ubuntu on the\r\ndrive, but I had to make sure it reformatted the partition</p>\n<p>I did run into a few problems, after installation though, which is\r\nunderstandable since SteamOS is -in beta-.</p>\n<h3>Black screen after installation</h3>\n<p>It looks like the Radeon card doesn’t work straight out of “the box”</p>\n<p>I had to follow these steps in order to get the video card working, from\r\nReddit <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamOS/comments/22pgp3/working_suggestions_for_black_screen_after/\">Working suggestions for black screen after</a></p>\n<p>After getting that all sorted, the next problem I ran into</p>\n<h3>Network problems</h3>\n<p>I had some interesting networking problems. My RealTech network card was\r\nnot installed by default. I had to insmod the device, then manually\r\nsetup the network card.</p>\n<p>It began to install Steam, and in the Steam installation, the network\r\ncard lost connectivity, for some odd reason, I had to fix it in the\r\nnetwork manager conf file, and set it to managed. From <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/71159/network-manager-says-device-not-managed/\">AskUbuntu</a></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ <span class=\"token function\">sudo</span> <span class=\"token function\">nano</span> /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf </code></pre></div>\n<p>and set managed to\r\ntrue</p>\n<p>Steam began to continue the installation after that.</p>\n<h3>In-house streaming world problems</h3>\n<p>I had a problem with In-house streaming. It appears that having\r\nVirtualBox installed messes with the network metric[4]</p>\n<p>Workaround -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open up Network and Sharing Center</li>\n<li>Click ‘Change Adapter Settings’</li>\n<li>Right click ‘VirtualBox Host-Only Network’, go to Properties</li>\n<li>Double click “Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)‘under ’This connection uses the following items’.</li>\n<li>In the Properties page, click ”Advanced…\"</li>\n<li>In the “Advanced TCP/IP Settings”, tab “IP Settings”, uncheck the box marked “Automatic Metic” and type in 800 or higher.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>OK all dialogs and run whatever software could not Recieve multicast.</p>\n<p>The problem stems from Microsoft assigning interface Metrics based on\r\nthe driver’s own reported Link speed in Windows 7. Since that’s all 1GB,\r\nthere is a clash on metric.
