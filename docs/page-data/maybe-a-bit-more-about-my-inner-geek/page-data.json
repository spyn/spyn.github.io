There’s a bit more it to the brief bio I put on\nthe website.</p>\n<p>I guess it all started when I was young, around the age of four, my\nparents were given a Commodore 64 by my Uncle - it came with a Tape deck\nand a cartridge game called <a href=\"http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2677&#x26;coverID=1634\">Tooth Invaders</a>. Interesting game, you\nwere given a set of teeth to look after and you had to fight germs off\nthe teeth with a toothbrush. Occasionally flossing between the teeth and\nyou had to avoid a little green dude who would kick your ass if he\ntouched you. A couple of years passed and there were a couple of people\nat school who also had a Commodore 64, we would borrow games and play\nthem. My Dad came back from Canada after visiting his father with a box\nfull with games, one that I got really addicted to was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_Mansion\">Maniac\nMansion</a>. Would have to say one of my most favorite games in the\nentire fucking world. You could choose 2 out of 6 players (you get stuck\nwith Dave, the most useless guy ever) each of the alternative 6 players\nhad different skills and abilities, which also meant you could complete\nthe game in many different ways. This formed my love for click adventure\ngames. Along with Maniac Mansion, was <a href=\"http://www.thehouseofgames.net/index.php?t=10&#x26;id=408\">Labyrinth</a>- I guess a pre-scumm\ngame, but it was very interactive and fun, also based on the movie. I\nguess this is where my love for gaming came from. Also playing Granny’s\nGarden on the BBC’s in primary school. That game scared the hell outta\nme, maybe it was her big pixel nose that bothered me. I don’t really\nremember.</p>\n<p>Later in life, I got access to a PC, 486 I think from memory. After\nschool I used to create games in ZZT. As well as rollerskating. That was\nall the rage back then. Pretty sure I made a ZZT game about Rolloways.\nBut anyway, I became more interested in other aspects of computing, such\nas hacking. I remember sitting in the computer labs at school, we only\nhad 486s - oh man we played STUNTS on them while the teachers were out,\nit was the fucking bomb! Pretty sure I managed to install a virus on one\nof the machines, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping-Pong_virus\">Ping-pong</a> and the teacher freaked out. Our school\nwasn’t exactly computer literate.</p>\n<p>I remember when we first got the internet at home. It was a dial-up\nshell account on Multiline. First browser I ever used? Lynx. When I was\n14, I remember printing out pages and pages of things to read, actually\nfrom the Triple J website (lets see if we can use the wayback machine on\nit.. <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.triplej.net.au\">oh yeah..</a> not that far though. All my friends were confused and\ndidn’t quite understand the use for it, I loved it!</p>\n<p>Later, in year 11 I discovered something called IRC.. ended up getting a\nbit too addicted to that and spent most my time online chatting to\npeople, writing scripts in mIRC and making new friends on AU's Undernet\nserver.. which ended up splitting off to oz.org because of so many\nnetsplits. I lurked in channel #Perth and #Perth-16-20 (lol) most. Too\nmuch time online ended my studies at high school pretty early in year</p>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>I started hanging around with an older crowd, students at UWA and\nsome other people. This is where I got introduced into lasertag, by a\nguy called RoaDKiLL. Every Monday night we would rock up to Zone 3\nNorthbridge for a weekly competition. Back then they were using the old\nV4 model P&#x26;C packs, which, are still the greatest zone packs on earth.\nWhy? THE TIMING IS SO DAMN PRECISE (the newer infusion packs, the ones\nthey have now at Darkzone, are not as responsive - because of the radio\nthat enables the live scoring, it needs to talk back and forth to the\nserver).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I became slack during this time, not doing much with my life. I was\nbeing very social online and not so much outside, except for the\noccasional rollerskating on Friday nights. Yes - I love skating, as you\nmight have already guessed. The rush of skating fast and dodging people\nis amazing. Back then I remember playing mutiplayer Heretic with one of\nmy UWA mates, over a 9600bps modem, it was fantastic. Also back then I\nwas getting into the Lucasarts click adventure games, Monkey Island - my\nmost favorite game in the universe. As I wasn't doing much, my step mum\ngot on my case, ended up getting me an apprenticeship at the company\nwhich she had recently purchased, Comfix. Back then there were no real\nIT courses so the apprenticeship I had to do was called Electronic\nServicing. At Comfix I was repairing Commodore 64s, Commodore Amigas,\nLynx Gamegears, PCs and other really old machines. I learnt so much from\nthat place, which inspired my love for gadgets :~)</p>\n<p>Later on, I found myself out of work then decided to look more into\nprogramming. Found myself working on a business application written in\nWin32-C. Yet was later replaced with a perl script. I begin hanging out\nwith a couple of my mates, one of them was doing studying computer\nscience at Murdoch -- another just chilling out. We used to play\nStarcraft every night, for weeks on end. I felt like I was doing\nnothing, I thought I might head back to what I know, IT support and to\nattend university at the same time.</p>\n<p>Later, one of my mates asked me if I was interested in working in a web\ndevelopment role. I enthusiastically said OH HELL YEAH and went to work\nfor them. That's when I was first introduced into PHP and ASP\nprogramming. I became more and more interested in what I could do with\nweb related services and databases. This was maybe one of my major\nturning points down to what I am currently doing today, working as a\nProgrammer at a local ISP.</p>\n<p>Gaming wise, I’ve just started to get into Lord of the Rings Online.\nIt’s free so I thought I might give it a chance, so far it’s okay – I’m\nplaying it with my fiancée, who is the most awesome and beautiful person\nin the entire whole world – but I’ll post more about her later ;~).\nInfact we recently just moved out together. I used play World of\nWarcraft quite a bit. I had a Warlock, Paladin, Druid and some other\ncharacters all up to 80. Once I hit 80 I wasn’t quite sure what to do,\nbecause I simply can’t stand raiding. It’s boring, repetitive and a\nmajor timesink. I did, however, enjoy world PVP, griefing is fun! – So I\nlearnt from playing hours and hours of EVE Online with a certain\ncorporation called GoonFleet. Industrial espionage in a MMORPG? oh hell\nyeah. We had a spymaster, <a href=\"http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/68172\">here is an article</a> on his work in the\ngame. I was one of the guys that stepped up and snuck an alt player into\none of our rival corporations, Lokta Veritas. It was bit of a fun\nexperience, trying to act undercover. I setup a PHP script on my server\nat home that posted everything that happened into LV’s corporation/gang\nchat window, so the spymaster could process the information and relay it\non to the people who needed the information. GoonFleet was a lot of fun,\njust being a general jerk in EVE Online surrounded by others who took it\nso so seriously.</p>\n<p>I enjoy making my life easier around the house, and smashing up scripts\nin PERL, BASH and PHP. I wouldn't go to the extent of creating an IP\ncontrolled toaster, but I would go to the effort of setting up a TV box\nwith XBMC - with notifications being pushed to it. Or gathering usage\nfrom various items around the house. I love data. DATA DATA DATA DATA,\nbut not the Brent Spiner kinda data. He was always an awkward android.</p>\n<p>I'm pretty big into scifi's and that kinda pop-culture thing. I watched\nthe entire Next Generation series while sitting at my desk at my old\njob, while smashing out code for the website we were working on. My\nfavorite store would have to be Minotaur in Melbourne. That place is god\ndamn amazing.</p>\n<p>I have a secret love for typography. mmmMmm typography.\nhell-vetica-yeah.</p>\n<p>Not to mention, I'm also a bit of a music geek. If I've heard the band\nbefore I can usually guess who they are, not to mention being able to\nspot known tunes within at least 15 second of the song actually playing.\nI love music.</p>\n<p>Puns? I love puns. Puns are amazing.</p>\n<p>I'm looking at doing some development work on the HTC Desire HD -\nandroid based phone. I have a few ideas and I'm going to see what I can\ncome up with. Of course I'll post what I make on my blog. (This thing,\nright here, you're on it now)</p>\n<p>So far I've posted on Twitter and Facebook, asking my mates to share my\niiNet's TopGeek vote url. As of yesterday I launched a banner campaign\non SomethingAwful as well as linking my URL on Delicious and Reddit.</p>\n<p>Vote for me please, I really want to beat Simon Hackett.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Maybe a bit more about my inner geek","date":"2010, Dec
